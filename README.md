# IntegrityCheck
IntegrityCheck: Ensure Your Data's Integrity with Ease  IntegrityCheck is a robust and user-friendly tool designed to help you maintain the integrity and security of your files using SHA-256 cryptographic hashing. Whether you need to verify the authenticity of a file, detect tampering, or create a unique digital fingerprint for your data


python3 IntegrityCheck.py



NOTE :- IntegrityCheck creates a unique hash value for any file, like a txt file. If someone changes or deletes any data in the file, the hash value will change and won't match the original one. This way, you can easily detect if the file has been tampered with.
